#Teeny Tiny CSS

I like the idea of using a CSS framework to speed up development, but all of the ones I've come across are too heavy for my taste. Thought it would be fun to roll my own.

The idea is to have something you can use to ensure that the layout of your website works and is responsive. Beyond that it doesn't force any conventions on you in the way of look, feel, colors, etc.
