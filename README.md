#Teeny Tiny CSS

CStatus: Alpha

I like the idea of using a CSS framework to speed up development, but all of the ones I've come across are too heavy for my taste. Thought it would be fun to roll my own.

The idea is to have something you can use to ensure that the layout of your website works and is responsive. Beyond that it doesn't force any conventions on you in the way of look, feel, colors, etc.

HEAVILLY dependant on Flex Box, so it's older browesr support is probably pretty bad.

#Installation
```
$ bower install teenytinycss
```
cd into the directory where it was installed (I am assuming ``bower_components`` and then run ``$ gulp``

#Setup
Link the teenytiny.css fil into your HTML document. Assuming you didn't edit the gulpfile, it should be something like ``bower_components/teenytinycss/dist/css/teenytiny.css``

#Grid

#Forms
